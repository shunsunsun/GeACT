# Dataset
## Definition
A dataset consists of the data from one sequencing experiment.  
A dataset corresponds to several samples, each of which contain the multiplex data from one 96-well plate.  

## Naming rules
For the first five datasets, they were named as "order + (system abbreviation + organ number) + sample number" (e.g. 13_D1_48).  
As the system increased, other datasets were named as "order + (date) + sample number" (e.g. 18_190930_48).  

## Note
`27_210303_07` is a special dataset, where the 5â€™ primer sequences (19bp) need to be removed in Read 2 before the standard pipeline.
